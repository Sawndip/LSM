# __Liquid State Machine__

### _Simulation and optimization of a liquid state machine_
Implementation details for the liquid are given in: Maass, W. *"Real-time Computing Without Stable States: A New Framework for Neural Computation Based on perturbations."* Neural Computations 14, 2002: 2531-2560.

## Installation instructions:
- Use CMake to set the directories of the required libraries. 
- Generate the project and build it
- running main will simulate an LSM, and evolve, it to optimize its performance on a given problem.

## Required libraries:
1. NeMo-0.7.2
2. boost_1_55_0
3. Eigen3
4. Gaul-0.1849

## Tested on:
* Ubuntu 14.04
